        <h2> My Report</h2>
        <p> My journey learning HTML and CSS this year has been easier than anticipated but that doesnt mean I didn’t
            face some difficulties along the way. The lecture notes and lecture sessions are organised very well to help
            a beginner like me to understand it from the get-go.</p>

        <p>At the very beginning I was introduced to only HTML, I started learning the basics such as the files having a
            html extension on the end of them and learning the html tag formula and HTML tags and how to nest tags, this
            is all was very straight forward and I had no problem progressing on from this, as it was very easy to
            memorise the tags and what they do. Then we went onto learning the attributes such as img tags and absolute
            and relative URLs and that also was very easy to wrap my head around.</p>

        <p>As we moved onto CSS the task got slightly more complicated as there was a lot to learn and memorise, as a
            lot of the coding is done on CSS, and it is more complex than HTML. At the beginning it started of simple, I
            learned how you take a html element and then you can change it in CSS for e.g., you can change its colour,
            and I learned you can use class selectors to target a group of elements instead of one but later it got
            difficult.</p>

        <p>My experience using HTML and CSS to create my website for this assignment was not as challenging as I thought
            it would be but later down the line this changed. At the beginning I created my files and used anchor tags
            to link them across the 5 different pages and then created buttons for them and all this was not that
            difficult I didnt run into any issues doing this. It was all very easy to do, but it got hard after the
            semantic html elements were introduced.</p>

        <p>Once I had to start introduced the CSS file for the mobile version this is where things started to get a
            little more difficult. Adding sub menus and giving them a sliding effect for mobile was quite challenging,
            adding the hover effect to the hamburger icon for desktop and optimising the website for mobile was a little
            challenging. I managed to overcome my issues by referring to my lecture notes and lecture recoding for
            guidance and experimenting and trying different formulas to correct my mistake. One of the biggest benefits
            I had was developer tools, this was a huge help because I was able to find something I wanted to fix, and I
            would use inspect to try different alternatives and see which one would correct my mistake and doing it this
            was means It wouldnt save to my own file. Also validating my CSS code was a useful tool to target where the
            mistakes were being made.</p>



        <h2> Module Experience</h2>
        <p> My module experience has been good eventhough due to my circumstances i had to study from home.</p> I found the
            lecture recordings to be
            well layed out so i could still feel like im in a lecture and i could complete the excercises that were set,
            so this allowed me to
            enjoy my experience in this module and further my understanding in html and css.<p> Having to learn from the
            recordings i would say
            i was still able to undertand and learn the same way i would have in a lecture, i was still very interested
            in learning and wanted to
            keep on learning more so i could see myself make progress.</p><p>Overall i enjoyed this module and found it very
            interesing and fun, it was also
            challenging at times which made it a better experience because you want to find the mistake you made and see
            how you can fix it or improve your code. </p>
